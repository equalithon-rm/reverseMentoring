# Elevate - A Web App to address gender equality through reverse mentoring

**Our Goal**

The goal of the app is to provide a platform for female employees to showcase their skills and be provided mentorship.

**Reverse Mentoring**
  It is a career development practice that helps businesses mine certain insights and information of the less experienced, often younger employees for senior executives.
