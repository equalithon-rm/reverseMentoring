# Elevate - A Web App to address gender equality through reverse mentoring

* Our Goal

The goal of the app is to provide a platform for female employees to showcase their skills and provide mentorship.

* Reverse Mentoring
  It is a career development practice that helps businesses mine certain insights or information of the less experienced, often younger employees for senior executives.
